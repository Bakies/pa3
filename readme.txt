the odds.png pushes 0 then, takes the input doubles it and subtracts 1, it takes that number and dups it then subtracts two until it hits one. Once the number is one it prints out the stack (until it hits the 0) then exits.
gcd takes two input, dups the second input checks if its 0 (prints the first input if it is) dups the second input again and then mods it against the first input. then it returns to the beginning using the new values instead of user input
